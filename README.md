### Question:
### What does the population distribution between different regions of the world look like from 1970 through projected 2050?

* East Asia and the Pacific, South Asia, and Sub Saharan Africa lead the charge in future global population growth.
* However East Asia and the Pacific does level off with just under 2.5billion people by 2030.
* The European Union and Central Europe and the Baltics see little to no population growth in the last fifty years, nor are they projected to in the next thirty.
* The U.S. also only increases its population nominally 1970-2050 never reaching 400,000,000, and Latin America and the Caribbean levels off by 2040 with about 760,000,000.

### Question:
### How does the fertility rate change between regions between 1970-2020?
* Fertility Rate (Total Births Per Woman) Declines Dramatically 1970-2000.
* However fertility remains steady between 1.5-2 children per woman for five out of eight regions by around 2020 with South Asia catching up by 2040.
* The Middle East and North Africa isn't far behind however and has just over two children by 2050, and Sub Saharan Africa has three children per woman by 2050, but is still on a downward trend.
* East Asia & the Pacific has the most dramtic drop in 30 years with just over 5 children per woman in 1970, to less than two children by 2000.
* Latin America & the Carribbean is similar with just over five children per woman in 1970 as well, and by 2020 it too is down to two children per woman.
* The European Union, Central Europe and the Baltics, and the United States were all just above two children per woman in 1970 with the European Union and Central Europe and the Baltics dropping to less than two children by the next decade, and the U.S. hovering around two children per woman until 2010 where they too finally dropped below and now remains steady.
