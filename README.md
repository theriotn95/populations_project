# Populations_Project
  
  For this project we analyzed a data set containing various global population quantitative facts and statitsics. The questions we asked of our data focused on analyzing 8 major regions of the world, and looking at the growth rates, population distributions, and fertility rates in those regions mainly from 1970-2020 while also including projections up until 2050. In order to answer the questions we asked of our data we used various matpoltlib plotting methods including, box charts, line plots, and pie charts.
